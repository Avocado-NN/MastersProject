# Error that found this issue:
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/24904

# Important to consider the following:
if you can paste in your complete code that would help us debug. 
Ultimately, though, based on the error, I think you are returning something 
non-standard from your forward method. You can only return tensors and tuples 
of tensors. I took a quick look at https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3 
and nothing obvious jumped out at me there.

# It is critical that the forward function only returns tensors or tuple of tensors!
