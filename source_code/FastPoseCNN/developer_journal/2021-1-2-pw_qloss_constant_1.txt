Problem:
Currently, the pixel-wise qloss error for the quaternion is constantly 1, mostly 
due to that we are taking the mean of the entire image and background is filled 
with 1s. This is why the average is mostly 1.

Solution:
I plan on making the average only take into account the area of the union between
the predicted and ground truth segmentation mask.

Removed the unecessary masking of the predicted mask towards the predicted 
quaternion, since this is already done the forward method of the model. 

Used the union mask between the predicted and ground truth to take the masked
average of the difference, error = (1 - accuracy). accuracy = <q1, q2>^2.
