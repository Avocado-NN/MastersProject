Problem:
Need to add the decoder that handles translation (xyz) and include all additional
components in the training loop to allow the training of these features.

Added the decoder branches and heads for both 'xy' and 'z' pixel-wise features.
All necessary code, such as changing `class_compress_quaternion` to 
`class_compress` to accomodate for all types of data was a success. I also expanded
the function `dense_class_data_aggregation` to account for the new entries. Also 
expanded the function `find_matches_batched` to account for the new entries.

With the addition of all the pytorch tensor intensive code, the training loop is 
still functional. Pushing as training is stable. Plan on making visualization for
the new regressed features. Afterwards, will look into difference loss functions 
and data augmentations (such as log(z/1000) to make it easier for regression 
stability).

git pushed: added xy and z components to the model and training loop.
